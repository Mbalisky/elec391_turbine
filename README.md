# WIND TURBINE
Arduino powered wind turbine using MPPT and PWM

## Requirements for first DEMO
- [] read multiple ADC channels
- [] act upon the PWM to move a stepper motor

## Final Requirements
Use the Arduino to collect data from a wind direction sensor, voltage and current from a boost converter. This should then use Maximum Power Point Tracking. 


This includes using PWM to control the switches in a boost converter

## MPPT

* Trial and Error Method: continue increasing until the power decreases, then start decreasing or increaseing PWM duty cycle to reach a maximum
* coeff of power vs tip speed ratio graph
